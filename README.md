Business Problem
Netflix wants to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset (~82K rows) of movies and shows but struggles with analyzing it effectively due to its size and complexity.

Proposed Solution
To solve this, I’ll use SQL for extracting key metrics like viewer ratings, genre trends, and popularity patterns. Then, I’ll use Tableau to build an interactive dashboard for visualizing insights. This will help Netflix explore data by genre, region, and demographics, enabling data-driven content and strategy decisions.
