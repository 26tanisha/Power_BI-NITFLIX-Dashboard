Tools Used: Pandas, MySQL, Power Bi
Business Problem
Netflix wants to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset (~82K rows) of movies and shows but struggles with analyzing it effectively due to its size and complexity.

Proposed Solution
To solve this, Iâ€™ll use SQL for extracting key metrics like viewer ratings, genre trends, and popularity patterns. Then, Iâ€™ll use Tableau to build an interactive dashboard for visualizing insights. This will help Netflix explore data by genre, region, and demographics, enabling data-driven content and strategy decisions.
